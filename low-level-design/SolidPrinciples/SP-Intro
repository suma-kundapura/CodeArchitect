Introduction to SOLID Principles:

Software development is like building a city—if the roads, buildings, and infrastructure
aren’t planned well, things quickly become chaotic. SOLID principles help developers
create structured, scalable, and maintainable software by following five fundamental
design guidelines in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). These principles ensure that
software is flexible, reusable, and easy to modify without unintended consequences.

What Are SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym representing five design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) in early 2000.
These principles form the foundation of clean software architecture in OOP.

Principle Definition:

S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) | A class should have only one reason to change.
O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP) | Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) | Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering correctness.
I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) | Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

How Did SOLID Principles Emerge?

Before SOLID, software development faced several challenges:
1 Tightly coupled code – Small changes in one part of the system affected other unrelated parts.
2 Low reusability – Developers had to rewrite the same logic in different places.
3 Difficult maintenance – As codebases grew, debugging and extending became a nightmare.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) became popular, but poorly designed OOP
 systems still suffered from these issues.
 In 2000, Robert C. Martin introduced the SOLID principles as a way to standardize best practices
 for writing flexible and maintainable OOP code.

The term "SOLID" was later coined by Michael Feathers after identifying the acronym from Uncle Bob’s work.

Use Cases of SOLID Principles

 1. Building Scalable Applications
- In microservices architecture, SOLID ensures that each service has a single responsibility and is independent.

 2. Enterprise Software Development
- Helps create large systems (banking, healthcare, e-commerce) that can evolve without breaking existing functionality.

 3. Framework & API Design
- Libraries like Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Angular follow SOLID principles to remain extensible and maintainable.

 4. Improving Testability
- SOLID promotes loosely coupled code, making it easier to write unit tests using frameworks like JUnit & Mockito.

 5. Reducing Development & Maintenance Costs
- Avoids rewriting code by making components reusable, thus reducing technical debt.

Final Thought

SOLID principles are not just rules but a mindset that helps developers write better code.
Whether you're designing a small application or a large enterprise system, applying these
principles ensures clean, maintainable, and scalable software.
